Settled 2026-09-26:
1. Stack: Tauri 2, Rust core, Svelte 5.
2. Look: even 50/50 hybrid. Pixel frames and notched corners, clean legacy type inside. Pixelify for display only; the Legibility Rule carries over.
3. Port the landing and hub, the custom island, the IntAssis deck and AI, and all 15 rooms.
4. Moments: living campus landing, sync as a jeepney journey, grade reveal stamps, pixel empty states.
5. v1: sign-in, schedule (week and today), island glance, grades and GPA, reminders, landing, rooms, moments.
6. AI on the device first, cloud subscription later.
7. Data on the device only; sync with the cloud tier.
8. Island in the app for v1; widgets and Live Activity later.
9. No store accounts yet; emulator, simulator and sideloading until the beta.
10. Private repo until the beta; desktop builds in CI but doesn't ship.")

p0=$(issue "P0: repo, docs and CI" wayfinder:task "Part of #$map

Copy the legacy docs into docs/legacy/, write CONTEXT.md and ADR-0001/0002, set up CI (cargo test, svelte-check, vitest, Tauri desktop build).")
s0=$(issue "S0: SIS sign-in over plain HTTP from Rust" wayfinder:prototype "Part of #$map

spikes/s0-sis-http. The student runs it with their own credentials. Answer: does /schedule return rows after a plain HTTP form POST? If yes, the core owns SIS access. If no, a small Tauri plugin hosts a hidden native webview and the core still parses the HTML.")
s1=$(issue "S1: Tauri 2 + Svelte shell on Android and iOS" wayfinder:prototype "Part of #$map

Measure the landing canvas scene at 60 fps, store a secret in the Keychain or Keystore, and fire a local notification, on the Android emulator and the iOS simulator.")
api=$(issue "Core API design (architect)" wayfinder:research "Part of #$map

Run /pstack:architect on the boundary between the core and the UI: Tauri commands and events, domain types, errors.")
core=$(issue "Core crate: types, parsers, SIS, logic, SQLite" wayfinder:task "Part of #$map

ClassSession, Term, GradeReport, Campus, Mark. Parsers ported from Swift, with the old fixtures as literal expected values. SISHost failover. GPA, NextClass, DayAgenda, IslandGlance (5 cases). SQLite store.")
ds=$(issue "Design system: rooms, hybrid pixel components, gallery" wayfinder:task "Part of #$map

Tokens ported from Palette.Roles.derived with contrast clamps for all 15 rooms. NotchFrame, Stamp, PixelButton, Dither. Fonts, the Legibility Rule, a Reduce Motion store. A gallery route for review.")
shell=$(issue "Shell prototype: island, navigation, sign-in, campus landing" wayfinder:prototype "Part of #$map

The real Svelte shell with demo data. HITL: the student reviews screenshots before Schedule and Grades build on it.")
sched=$(issue "Schedule: week, today, marks, island glance" wayfinder:task "Part of #$map

Week and today views with WeekTurn, vacant and online marks, subject colours, the glance, the Schedule controls in the island, empty-state scenes.")
grades=$(issue "Grades: GPA, trend, stamps" wayfinder:task "Part of #$map

GPA, the trend across past terms, units progress, grade reveal stamps.")
rem=$(issue "Reminders, sync journey, settings" wayfinder:task "Part of #$map

Weekly local notifications, the jeepney sync journey, the Settings screen with a wiring test that fails when a stored preference has no reader.")
